With the expansion of sequencing techniques and molecular biology tools, first step of instauring new model species starts with the sequencng and inference of a reference genome. We recently sequenced various species of non-biting mosquitoes (<i>Toxorhynchites brevipalpis</i> and <i>Wyeomnia smithii</i>) and marine species (<i>Eurydice pulchra</i> and <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i>). 

Recently we also used Nanopore technology for the frog biting mosquito <i>Culex territans</i> (with Dr Chloé Lahondère, VT).
