<i>Perisphaerus</i> genus (Blaberidae, Perisphaerinae) includes cockroaches living in Africa and Indonesia. Multiple radiation events have been describe in the Indonesian region, starting from birds by Wallace (1863) who assumed the physical geographic history as a diversification driver isolating various population on different islands (peripatric speciation).

However, the relationships of <i>Perisphaerus</i> with other genus remain unclear, preventing the study of the Wallacean hypothesis. While lots of species remain undescribed, <i>Perisphaerus</i> delimitation stay obscur with <i>Pseudoglomeris</i>, <i>Corydidarum</i> and <i>Trichoblatta</i> (all synonymous for the same species), using the unique capacity of <i>Perisphaerus</i> to roll up in a full ball as a discrimination factor (Li et al., 2018).

We thus realised a molecular phylogeny of <i>Perisphaerus</i>, <i>Pseudoglomeris</i>, <i>Corydidarum</i> and <i>Trichoblatta</i> species living in the Indonesian area (from China to Australia) in order to clarify the taxonomy and systematic of this group.
