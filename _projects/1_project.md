Mosquitoes perceive their environment combining multimodal cues including vision, hearing, smelling, chemosensation, thermosensation and CO2 sensation. As some female mosquitoes require blood-meal to get the needed energy for oviposition, most research on host-seeking behaviour focuses on a single species with male vs. female differences. 

Here we are exploring the evolution of the sensory system in mosquitoes using phylogenomics tools {% cite Devilliers2024.08.07.607008 %} and molecular biology methods {% cite doi:10.1098/rsbl.2024.0245 %}, comparing both bood-feeding vs. non-blood feeding species, and sexes. The overarching goal of this project is to identify sensory modalities and genes involved in mating and host-seeking behaviour. 

In this project we particularly focussed on vision evolution, combining phylogenomics, bulk RNA-seq in the eye of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, <i>Toxorhynchites brevipalpis</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, miscroscopy (HCR) and single-cell RNA-seq on the head of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.
